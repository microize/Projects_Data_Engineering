Turning raw data into pure power—this repository is a collection of my data engineering projects, where complex datasets are transformed into streamlined, actionable assets. From designing robust ETL pipelines to architecting scalable data infrastructures, these projects showcase the backbone of modern data solutions. Dive in to explore how messy, unstructured data becomes the fuel for analytics, machine learning, and beyond.

## Project Highlights

- **Project 1: [Developing Input Features for Personalized Marketing](https://github.com/your-username/data-engineering-projects/blob/main/01.etl-ecommerce_develop_input_features.ipynb)**
  - Developed input features for an ML model to enhance marketing strategy, focusing on transforming visitor log and user data into actionable metrics like views, user activity, and product interactions. This enables targeted advertisements and personalized offers to boost revenue and conversion rates.
